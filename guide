Guide:

Download dcrate 1.0.html to run the browser version.
Or, you can download the .pmp version if you want to edit the project with Penguin Mod. If you create your own version, be sure to credit me.
---------------------------------
1. Click "Create DCrate" and drag or select a file by clicking in the center. You can click the edges to cancel.

2. After uploading the file, the file information will appear in the center, such as the name, edit date, and size.

3. On the right, you'll find a button to copy it to the clipboard. (It will ask for notification permission even if you've already authorized it. This is a bug; it's not worth authorizing.)
